# spatstatSphere: Point patterns on the sphere

This repository is an effort to combine R code for point patterns on the sphere
and general geometrical computations on the sphere developed by:

- Adrian Baddeley
- Tom Lawrence
- Tuomas Rajala
- Ege Rubak

It depends on the R package `spatstat` (and possibly other packages) and it
could be considered a plugin to `spatstat` enabeling direct analysis of point
patterns on the sphere without having to project to a planar map.

It is currently **development mode** and no R code is released yet, so there is nothing interesting about this repository at the moment.
